How do I approach designing software?
Working on this project helped me develop stronger modular design skills. I learned to separate concerns across classes like “SceneManager”, “ViewManager”, and “ShaderManager”, rather than placing all the logic into a single file.
My design process followed a structured path:
-	Plan the 3D scene layout based on a real-world image
-	Implement basic object models with low-polygon shapes
-	Iterate textures, lighting, and camera controls
-	Refine the scene based on visual balance and functionality.

This design approach will help in my future work by allowing me to build scalable and manageable projects.

How do I approach developing programs?
For development, I used incremental building and frequent testing. Instead of trying to complete everything at once, I built small sections and constantly ran the program to make sure each change worked as expected. My approach to development evolved from basic "trial-and-error" into a much more structured and test-driven workflow by the end of the project.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Learning computational graphics and visualizations taught me spatial problem solving and performance optimization, as well as skills that apply directly to software development, simulation building, and game design. 

In my future educational pathway, these skills will support more advanced graphics courses and technical electives. They strengthen my foundation for careers involving interactive 3D applications.
